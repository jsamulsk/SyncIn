# SyncIn
Android mobile app for scheduling. Implemented with native Java and LAMP backend.
(Does not inlcude entire app, only source and build files. Only PHP API included for server, can run on any LAMP server.)

The app is designed to find free time among multiple Google calendars. It uses a back-end server to support the app and make the necessary Google API calls.

The Android folder contains the source code, both classes and activities. There are three activities and one helper class:

<ul>
  <li>Login Activity</li>
  <li>Main Activity</li>
  <li>Schedule Activity</li>
</ul>
